                <h1>Stephen Rosen</h1> 
                <p class="p1">Who is Steven Rosen you ask? Well first, he is my father. A remarkable one at that. <br />He is also one of the coolest people I know. Maybe a little weird to some, but cool. <br /> He has taught me a lot, from how to drive stick to how to build a PC from scratch. <br /> So here, on this website, let’s take a quick peek at this young strapping lad’s life. </p>
            </div> 
            
            <br /><br /><hr />

            <div id="main-content">

                

                <div class="Org2">
                    <h2 id="Origins" class="org">Origins</h2> 
                    <p class="p2">Growing up Stephen had his hands in a ton of different baskets. He was an experienced ninja (martial arts but same thing, right?), he was a talented trombonist, an invested Dungeon and Dragon’s player, and a phenomenal son. Shortly after finishing high school, Steve continued his life at the University of Texas at Austin. He went there to finally pursue his lifelong dream of becoming a full-time professional ninja. Unfortunately, Stephen was not well equipped enough in his abilities, and thus became the next best thing to a ninja- A Computer Scientist! On a serious note, my Dad led a fulfilling and successful life at UT. He enjoyed his days playing in the marching band for the football team, getting phenomenal grades, and spending time with his future wife.   </p>

                <div class="Fam2">
                    <h2 id="Family" class="fam">Family</h2>
                    <p class="p3">After meeting my Mom, Stephen’s wonderful family began to form. <br /> First came the eldest and most troublesome son, Brandon, who was born in July of 1995. <br /> Then came the greatest child, Travis (thats me!) born in August of 97’. <br /> Next up... actually, this might look better to just show you!<br /> </p>

                <div class="Work2">
                    <h2 id="Work" class="work">Work & Community</h2>
                    <p class="p4">Currently, Steve is the Executive Director of Financial and Administrative Systems at Valero Energy. This year marks 20 years at Valero for him. He has been, in my humble and professional opinion, one of the most hard-working and loyal employees for Valero. His career is filled with accomplishments and highlights. A few years ago, he led a team into the UK and Ireland on an acquisitions project. It was the companies first venture into Europe. There is a ton of other fantastic achievements my dad has completed while at Valero, and while I do not really understand much of it, he has continuously proven himself as a motivated and diligent man.  Not only is he a hard worker, but he puts forth a ton of effort for the betterment of his community. He is currently one of the board members for The Boys and Girls Club of San Antonio. </p>
